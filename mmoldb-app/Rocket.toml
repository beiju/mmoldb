# This configuration file is for Rocket, the web framework that powers the 
# mmoldb website and ingest. It also contains several mmoldb-specific
# configuration parameters.
#
# This config file has a [default] section and a [debug] section. The [default]
# section always applies, no matter how you run mmoldb. If you're running in
# debug mode, any values in the the [debug] section override the corresponding
# values in the [default] section. In release mode the values in the [debug]
# section are ignored. If you don't know what mode you're running in, it's
# probably release.

[default]
# The port to listen on. This must match the port that docker exposes, which is
# configured in either .devcontainer/devcontainer.json (for the devcontainer
# setup) or docker-prod/docker-config.yml (for the plain docker compose setup).

# value is 1000. Decreasing this value can improve memory usage during ingest
# at the cost of speed.
# Note: If you change this, and you have http response caching enabled, you
# will get a duplicate copy of every event in your cache. There is currently
# no way to delete just the old cache entries. If you want to delete the
# entire cache you can do that by deleting the mmoldb_http-cache volume.

# The number of pages of games to ingest simultaneously. By default this
# is set to the thread count of your cpu. Decreasing the value can improve
# memory and cpu usage during ingest at the cost of speed.

# will fail because they try to use more connections than are available.

# connections. This must be lower than max_connections in your postgresql.conf
