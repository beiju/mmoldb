As of Season 2 this only happens when the previous PA was interrupted

values for `batter_subcount` are 0 and 1, but future game mechanics may
make higher numbers possible.

This is used in combination with `batter_count` to group plate
appearances. If you want to group all the pitches, from before and
after the caught-stealing, into a single plate appearance use
`group by batter_count`. If you want to count the interrupted plate
appearance and the subsequent plate appearances as two separate groups
of events, use `group by batter_count, batter_subcount`. If you want to
only include events from the last consecutive plate appearance
(discarding the rest), the query is more complicated.
Here's an example:

```
select
    count(1)
from data.events e
where batter_subcount = (
    select max(batter_subcount)
    from data.events e2
    where e2.game_id = e.game_id

group by
    game_id,
    top_of_inning,
    batter_count,
    batter_subcount
```

Note that if you only want the last event in each group of consecutive
plate appearances, it's sufficient to group by `batter_count` and then
select the row with the highest `game_event_index`, which should be
much faster.

Or, if you only want the plate-appearance-ending events, join
`taxa.event_type` and filter on `ends_plate_appearance`. As of Season 2
there should only be one event with `ends_plate_appearance = true` for
each `(game_id, top_of_inning, batter_count)` combination.

- Automatic runners (aka ghost runners or Manfred runners) appear in
  this table with a `base_before` of 2. There is no row with
  `base_before = null` for an automatic runner. As of Season 2, this is
  the only way for a chain of `event_baserunners` rows to begin with a
  non-null `base_before`.
- Once a runner reaches base (including the automatic runner) they will
  have a row in this table for every subsequent event until one of the
  following happens:
  1. They score, in which case the last row in the chain has
     `base_after = 0` and `is_out = false`.
  2. They are put out, in which case the last row in the chain has
     `is_out = true`. Note that runners can be put out at home.
  3. They are stranded on base when the inning ends, in which case the
     last row in the chain has `base_after <> 0` and `is_out = false`.
  Each subsequent row for a given batter will have `base_before` equal
  to their previous row's `base_after`.
- Runners who do not move during an event have a row with
  `base_before = base_after`.

At various times in MMOLB's short history, and for various event types,
the fielders have been identified differently. There are two main
issues:

1. Pitchers are sometimes described as "P" (for "Pitcher"), and at
   other times with their assigned slot on the team's roster. This
   means that when a position player is pitching, and fields the ball,
   they are sometimes (correctly) called "pitcher" and other times
   (incorrectly) labeled with the position they usually play.
2. Players on superstar teams play different positions than they do on
   their usual teams. Superstar games sometimes describe the player
   with their correct position for the superstar team, and other times
   (incorrectly) use the position that player has on usual team.

See the documentation of `taxa.slot` for even more details.

Historical and current player information.

This table contains basic information about a player, like their name and
birthday. It has many child tables with more advanced information like their
augment and recompose history, their clubhouse reports, and their equipment.
Most of these tables use `valid_from` and `valid_until` to track which version
of the player data was active at any point in time.

For any of these tables, `valid_from` is the date (always UTC) when this
version of the player was first observed, and `valid_until` is the date when
a different version of the player was first observed, or `null` if this is
still the active version. The range of times when the player version was valid
is therefore `valid_from` inclusive to `valid_until` exclusive. The
(non-`null`) `valid_until` of one version should exactly match the `valid_from`
of the next version.

Remember that these are the dates of *observations* of the versions. In reality
the data changed sometime between the last observation of the previous version
(which is not currently exposed by chron) and the first observation of the new
version. In fact, caching and network delay may mean that the change actually
occurred on the "wrong" side of the `valid_from`/`valid_until` date. This
should hopefully be rare.

To select only active versions, add `where valid_until is null` to your query.
To select the version that was active at a given time `t`, add
`where valid_from <= t and (valid_until > t or valid_until is null)` to
your query. Remember to group that in parentheses if you're adding it to other
`where` clauses that are combined using `or`.

Much of the player information is in child tables:
- `data.player_modification_versions` has the player modifications. This now
  includes Greater and Lesser boons, which were formerly on the player object.
- `data.player_equipment_versions` has the equipment equipped by each player.
- `data.player_equipment_effect_versions` has the attribute effects on each
  piece of equipment.
- `data.player_attribute_augments` has the record of all augments to attributes
  each player has recieved.
- `data.player_paradigm_shifts` has the record of all paradigm shifts that have
  affected this player.
- `data.player_recompositions` has the record of all times this player has been

The MMOLB id for this player. This is the preferred way to identify a player.

Keep in mind that recomposing players does *not* change their MMOLB id. If you
want to separate recomposed players (and you generally should), there are two
ways to do it. One is to group by name as well as id (it must be both, because
there are many examples of players with the same name), and assume every name
change is a recomposition. That's not strictly true, there have been players
whose name was changed without a recomposition, but not many.

The other option is to use `data.player_recompositions` to track the generation
of the player id, i.e. how many times it's been recomposed. Then each
`(mmolb_player_id, generation)` represents a unique player. Unfortunately,
there are (as yet unexplained) instances where the straightforward association
between recompositions and their player version chooses the wrong player.

If you want to do it that way, you can use a query like this one:

```
select
	*,
	(select count(1)
	 from data.player_recompositions pr
	 where pr.mmolb_player_id=pv.mmolb_player_id
	 	and pr.time < pv.valid_from

from data.player_versions pv

description = """
Records every instance of a player being recomposed.

This table is more complicated because there have been 3 distinct recompose
bugs that have been handled by deleting and/or inserting inferred
recompositions which aren't present in the feed. Inferred recompositions have
the `feed_event_index` of the first feed event to happen *after* them, but also
have an `inferred_event_index`.

The 3 bugs have been:
1. Some recompositions were reverted entirely, and their events were removed
   from  the player feed. These have been handled by suppressing the
   recompositions entirely, so they don't appear in this table. After more
   investigation the handling may or may not change to insert two inferred
   recompositions in quick succession, with the latter reverting the former.
2. Some recompositions occurred without a feed event. These have been handled
   by adding an inferred recomposition. The time for these inferred
   recompositions is set to the first time we observed the recomposed player,
   and the season and day derived from that time.
3. Some recompositions had their feed event and attributes reverted, but not
   their name change. These have been handled by suppressing the real
   recompositions (for the short time they appeared) and inserting an inferred
   recomposition to replace it (making it permanent), plus an additional
   recomposition when the overwrite happens. This latter recomposition doesn't
   change the player name, but does change their attributes. It's also marked
   as reverting the prior recomposition.

   Because of this bug, it is not entirely true to assume that player
   attributes after a recomposition are within the newly-generated-player
   boundaries. You can check for non-`null` `reverts_recomposition` to see if
   the "recomposed" player's attributes weren't freshly generated and may have
   been subject to augments.
